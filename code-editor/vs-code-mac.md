## Add VS Code to PATH \(macOS only\)

We need to make VS Code findable by **Terminal**.

Open the **Command Palette** by selecting **View** ![](../.gitbook/assets/arrow-right.svg) **Command Palette...**.

Type 'shell command' and select **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH**


## Open Integrated Terminal

Visual Studio Code has a built in terminal. This makes it easy for us to use the command line while also writing code without having to switch between applications!

To open your terminal, select **Terminal** ![](../.gitbook/assets/arrow-right.svg) **New Terminal**. The terminal view opens along the bottom of your application. You can also open multiple terminals.

We will use multiple terminal tabs tomorrow during the workshop.
