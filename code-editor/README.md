# Microsoft Visual Studio Code

![](../.gitbook/assets/vs-code.png)

Visual Studio Code is the **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment \(**IDE**\) we use. It's software that helps you write the code. **IDE**s can do a lot of amazing things, such as:

* highlight the code so it's easier to identify expressions
* suggest completions to what you type
* help you navigate easily through the files in your project
* and a lot more...

After downloading we will configure it with extra tools called _extensions_ that will make your coding life easier.
