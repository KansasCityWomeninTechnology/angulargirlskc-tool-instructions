## Helpful Tips

{% hint style="info" %}
**View the worksheet and your IDE in split screen**

We recommend viewing the worksheet in split screen mode so you don't have to dig through your open applications to find the correct window. You can position the open application you're configuring to the other half of your screen.

**For Windows users**, use windows key + left arrow or windows + right arrow to resize the application and position to the left or right half of your screen.

**For Mac users**, hold down the full-screen button in the upper-left corner of a window to shrink and position to the left or right side of the screen. Release the button, then click another window to begin using both windows side by side.
