# Slack

![](../.gitbook/assets/slack.png)


Slack is a messaging application used for team collaboration and communication. We will use Slack throughout the workshop to communicate updates and offer assistance when you have questions. We will also use Slack after the workstop to keep in touch and offer ongoing support as you learn more about web development. 

[kcwit.slack.com](https://kcwit.slack.com/) is our 24x7 chat room and **#nggirlskc** is the channel we'll use for this workshop and beyond. 

To use Slack for the workshop, you will need to create a Slack account and be invited to the **#nggirlskc channel** on the Kansas City Women in Technology Slack team. 

You should have received an invite to join Slack in our pre-workshop email communication. If you have questions about the invite to Slack you received, or you did not receive an invite, grab a mentor for help. 

Open Slack to the #nggirlskc channel so that you can see any announcements posted there. Feel free to ask questions and share your progress on the channel so we can celebrate your success with you!
