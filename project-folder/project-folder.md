# Project Folder

Next, we will create a project folder to use for the workshop. 

You may be accustomed to creating folders in a file explorer on your computer to store documents like Word or Excel files. 

![Create Folder](../.gitbook/assets/create_folder.png)

We will do something very similar to that to create a folder to house our Angular project, only we will create it with the command line!

To begin, navigate to the command line on your computer. 

For Windows, open **GitBash**. 

For macOS & Linux, open the **Terminal**. 

In the command line, create a folder called 'nggirls-workshop' by entering the following command and then pressing `Return/Enter`:

```bash
mkdir nggirls-workshop
```
{% hint style="info" %}
We use the terms "Folder" and "Directory" interchangeably. They mean the same thing.

**mkdir** stands for 'make directory'. Then you provide the name of the directory that you want to create.

When you **mkdir** in the command line, you are doing the same thing as when you create a folder in a file explorer.
{% endhint %}

Now that you've created your folder, go back to the command line and enter the following command and press `Enter/Return`:

```bash
code .
```
This command will open the folder you just made in Visual Studio Code so that you can see what you've created.
