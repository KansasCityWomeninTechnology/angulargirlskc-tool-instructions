We will use GitHub, an essential cloud-based companion tool to Git. This is where your code repositories are stored.

GitHub allows you to publish your project on the web, copy (fork and clone) other open source projects and collaborate. We will use GitHub Pages to publish your project on the web by the end of this tutorial. To be able to publish your project, use the instructions below to create an account.
