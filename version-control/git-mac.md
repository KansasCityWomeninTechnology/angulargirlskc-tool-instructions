## Install Git on Mac

We will use the Homebrew Package Manager we installed in the Node & npm section to install Git. 

To begin, type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew install git
```

When the process completes, type:

```bash
git --version
```

to ensure Git was properly installed. If it is properly installed you should see something like 

```bash
git version 2.8.3
```
returned in the terminal.
