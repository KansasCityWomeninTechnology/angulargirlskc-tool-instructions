# Angular CLI

![Angular CLI logo](../.gitbook/assets/cli.png)

An advantage of Angular is its powerful **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface \(**CLI**\). This is a special tool we can use to quickly create an Angular application. The Angular CLI will scaffold the framework for a web application so we can be up and running in no time!

In VS Code, open a terminal window by selecting **Terminal** ![](../.gitbook/assets/arrow-right.svg) **New Terminal**.

{% hint style="info" %}
For the workshop you will use the terminal in VS Code. Having your IDE and terminals together in one application will make it easier to follow the tutorial without having to juggle between so many different application windows.
{% endhint %}


In the terminal, run the following command

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="command line" %}
```bash
npm install --global @angular/cli
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

To verify your installation, check the Angular CLI version by typing

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="command line" %}
```bash
ng version
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

If you see output with a version number, your Angular CLI installation is successful.

## **Congratulations!**

You've reach the end of the installation worksheet. You have installed all of the tools you will need to build your first Angular application!

Give yourself a pat on the back! We look forward to seeing you back here tomorrow to continue working on your to-do list app.
